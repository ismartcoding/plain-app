     * OkHttpClient used by the [coil3.network.okhttp.OkHttpNetworkFetcherFactory] for
     * image loading.
     *
     * `createUnsafeOkHttpClient()` was previously wired in here too, but that client is
     * built for the in-app HTTP server (which uses self-signed certs on the local network)
     * and intentionally only accepts hostnames that match
     * [NetworkHelper.isLocalNetworkAddress]. Public hostnames like `img2.baidu.com` are
     * therefore rejected with `SSLPeerUnverifiedException` even when the server's
     * certificate is otherwise valid, which silently broke every markdown image whose
     * source was a public https URL.
     *
     * This factory returns a stock OkHttp client: it trusts the system CA bundle
     * (so public CAs work normally) and uses OkHttp's [okhttp3.internal.tls.OkHostnameVerifier]
     * (so SAN-based hostname checks behave like every other Android app). The local-server
     * self-signed-cert use case stays covered by [createUnsafeOkHttpClient].
