 * Request-scoped context exposed to GraphQL resolvers via KGraphQL's

 * request and injects it into the KGraphQL `Context` so resolvers can read
 * headers and per-request attributes (e.g. the peer signature and timestamp
 * set during request decryption) without depending on `ApplicationCall`.
 *
 * The implementation deliberately holds an [HttpCall] reference rather than
 * platform-specific types, keeping resolvers in commonMain. Resolvers fetch
 * it via `context.get<GraphqlRequestContext>()` (which uses the reified
 * class as the lookup key, matching how KGraphQL stores components).
